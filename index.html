    <h1>Random Variables and Statistics</h1>
    <p>A Random Variable is a function that maps from a set of events, known as the sample space, to a set of values, like numbers.
    When we do statistics, we are trying to undo this process, we want to measure the events through the numbers. 
    Let's take the Normal Random Variable for example, from the Normal Distribution. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution> Recall its characteristic bell curve.</a>
    We only ever have the values of a few events to work with, and we do our best to guess the distribution of events that would most likely have led to that data.
    We try to recover the distribution of events from just a few numbers, kind of like forensics tries to reconstruct a crime from evidence.
    Good statisticians and crime scene investigators don't blame or pick distibutions at random, they also know when they <strong>don't have enough evidence</strong>, and to check their assumptions.
